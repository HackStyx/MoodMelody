# MoodMelody Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the required API keys for emotion detection and music recommendations.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

## Required API Keys

### 1. Emotion Detection API (Choose One)

#### Option A: OpenRouter API (Recommended - More Reliable)

**Steps:**
1. Go to [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Create a free account
3. Navigate to [API Keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
4. Click "Create Key"
5. Copy the key and add it to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
   ```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Uses Mistral Small 24B model (free)
- ‚úÖ More accurate than keyword detection
- ‚úÖ Provides reasoning for emotions
- ‚úÖ Better reliability and uptime
- ‚úÖ Free tier available

#### Option B: Hugging Face API (Alternative)

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
2. Create a free account or sign in
3. Navigate to [Settings > Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
4. Click "New token"
5. Give it a name (e.g., "MoodMelody")
6. Select "Read" permission
7. Copy the token and add it to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_token_here
   ```

**Note:** Hugging Face API has been experiencing reliability issues. OpenRouter is recommended.

#### Option C: No API Key (Fallback)

If you don't set up either API key, the system will use an enhanced keyword-based emotion detection system that works well for basic emotion recognition.

### 2. Spotify Web API Credentials

The music recommendation feature uses Spotify's Web API to find tracks based on emotional audio features.

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create app"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **App name**: MoodMelody
   - **App description**: Emotion-based music recommendations
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - **APIs used**: Web API
5. Click "Save"
6. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret
7. Add them to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

```

## Testing

After setting up your API keys:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. Submit a journal entry with emotional content
4. The system will:
   - Detect the emotion using Hugging Face
   - Generate music recommendations from Spotify
   - Display personalized tracks with preview capability

## Troubleshooting

### Hugging Face Issues
